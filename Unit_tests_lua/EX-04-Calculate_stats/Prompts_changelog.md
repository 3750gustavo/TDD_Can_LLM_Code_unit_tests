## Calculate Stats EX 04 versions

# Original Prompt: Write a Lua function called "calculate_stats" that takes three input lists of numbers. The function should calculate the mean and standard deviation for each list, and return these values as a dictionary with keys 'mean' and 'stddev'.

## Revisions

1. Write a Lua function named "calculate_stats" that accepts three lists of numbers as input. This function should calculate the mean and standard deviation for each list and return these values as a dictionary with keys 'mean' and 'stddev'.
   - Reason: This revision clarifies that the function should accept three lists of numbers as input and return the mean and standard deviation for each list as a dictionary.

2. Write a Lua function named "calculate_stats" that accepts three lists of numbers as input. This function should calculate the mean and standard deviation for each list and return these values as a dictionary with keys 'mean' and 'stddev', be sure to include the imports before the function definition.
   - Reason: This revision clarifies that the function should include the imports before the function definition.

3. Write a Lua function named "calculate_stats" that accepts three lists of numbers as input. This function should calculate the mean and standard deviation for each list using the population standard deviation formula, and return these values as a dictionary with keys 'mean' and 'stddev'. Be sure to include the necessary imports before the function definition.
   - Reason: This revision explicitly states the requirement to use the population standard deviation formula, ensuring consistency and accuracy across all implementations.

4. Write a Lua function named `calculate_stats` that accepts three lists of numbers as input. This function should calculate the mean and standard deviation for each list using the population standard deviation formula, and return these values as a dictionary with two keys: `'mean'` and `'stddev'`. Each key should correspond to a list containing the mean and standard deviation values for the input lists, respectively. Be sure to include the necessary imports before the function definition.
   - Reason: This revision clarifies that the function should return a dictionary with two keys, 'mean' and 'stddev', where each key corresponds to a list containing the mean and standard deviation values for the input lists, respectively. This ensures that the function returns the values in a consistent and structured format.
