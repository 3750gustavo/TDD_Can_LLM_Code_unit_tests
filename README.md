# TDD_Can_LLM_Code_unit_tests Repository Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and testing the capabilities of Language Learning Models (LLMs) in coding, particularly focusing on unit testing and statistical analysis implementations in Lua and Python. Our goal is to leverage LLMs to improve code quality and efficiency.

## Recent Highlights

- **EX-05 SVG Vector Implementations**: Initiatives to harness SVG vectors for graphical representations, pending the development of unit tests.
- **Lua Tests for SVG Dot Product**: Development of specific tests for SVG dot product calculations, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Statistical Calculations in Lua**: Introduction of raw Lua implementations for statistical analysis across various datasets, aimed at understanding LLM performance metrics.
- **Comprehensive Lua Testing Framework**: Establishment of a structured Lua testing framework to facilitate robust code testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it locally and explore the various Lua and Python scripts. Each script is designed to test different aspects of LLMs' coding capabilities, focusing on statistical analysis and graphical data representation.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome, especially in the areas of unit testing and expanding the repository's testing frameworks. If you have suggestions or improvements, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
