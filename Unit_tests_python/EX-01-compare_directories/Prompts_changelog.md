## compare directories EX-01 versions:

# Original Prompt: Write a python function called "compare_directories" that takes two input directories as parameters, then through a control variable that can be a list, dictionary or tuple, check all files for how many times you found a file with the same name, then for each one that was found 2 times (one in each directory), compare their modification dates. The final result to be displayed should be an 'OK' message if everything passed, otherwise display how many failed in each test and the names of the files that failed and where they failed.

## Revisions:

1. Write a python function named "compare_directories" that Compare two directories and their files.

Args:
    dir1 (str): Path to the first directory.
    dir2 (str): Path to the second directory.

Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the results of the comparison.
        The dictionary has the following keys:
            - "passed": A boolean indicating whether all tests passed (True) or not (False).
            - "failed_count": An integer representing the total count of failed tests.
            - "failed_tests": A list of dictionaries, each containing details of a failed test.
                Each dictionary has the following keys:
                    - "test": A string indicating the name of the failed test.
                    - "failed_files": A list of strings representing files that failed the test.
                    - "failure_location": A string indicating the location where the failure occurred, which can be "dir1", "dir2", or "both".
    - Reason: This revision is more specific about the function's behavior and requirements, including the return of a dictionary containing the results of the comparison, with keys indicating whether all tests passed, the total count of failed tests, and details of each failed test, including the name of the test, the files that failed the test, and the location where the failure occurred. This revision also removes the requirement to display an 'OK' message if everything passed, as this can be inferred from the results of the comparison.

2. Write a Python function `compare_directories` that compares two given directories (`dir1`, `dir2`) and returns a detailed report of the comparison as a dictionary. The function should meet the following requirements:

**Input Parameters:**

The function accepts two arguments:

* **Directory 1 (dir1)**: A path to the first directory to be compared.
* **Directory 2 (dir2)**: A path to the second directory to be compared.

Both directories contain similar sets of files, but potentially with differences in content and last modified dates.

**Output Report Structure:**

The function generates a detailed report summarizing the outcome of the comparison. The report consists of a dictionary with the following key-value pairs:

1. **Passed**: This value is True if all tests pass, and False if any test fails.

2. **Failed_Count**: The total count of failed tests.

3. **Failed_Tests**: A list of detailed descriptions of failed tests. Each dictionary in this list contains the following key-value pairs:

    * **Test**: A string describing the type of comparison test that failed.
    * **Failed_Files**: A list of file names that failed the test.
    * **Failure_Location**: A string specifying where the failed test occurred, i.e., 'dir1', 'dir2'.

PS: The Failure_Location is the directory with the oldest modification date for the files that failed the test, i.e., 'dir1' if the file with the same name in dir1 has an older modification date than the file in dir2.
    - Reason: This revision provides a more detailed description of the function's behavior and requirements, including the structure of the output report and the specific details to be included in the report. It also clarifies that the function should compare similar sets of files in the two directories and that the comparison should include differences in content and last modified dates.
