## display_text_file_gui EX 06 versions

# Original Prompt: Create an Python function called "display_text_file" that takes only one argument which is the path to the .txt file. This function should:
    - Read the contents of the specified .txt file
    - Parse the data from the file using a delimiter like ':'
    - Sort the values in descending order
    - Display the sorted names and corresponding values on a window GUI with line breaks between each name-value pair as they are present in the original text file.
    - Return a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful or not.
    If an error occurs during any of these steps, the function should return false and display an appropriate error message on the screen.
