## EXCEL Prompts EX 02 versions:

# Original Prompt: Write a Python function called "excel_sort" that takes an input Excel file path and column numbers as parameters, then sorts the data in each specified column in descending order using pandas library. Finally, display the sorted data.

## Revisions:

1. Write a Python function named "excel_sort" that accepts an Excel file path and column numbers as parameters. This function sorts the data in each specified column in descending order using the pandas library and returns a new Excel file containing the sorted data.
   - Reason: This revision clarifies that the function creates a new Excel file with sorted data instead of just displaying it.

2. Write a Python function called "excel_sort" that accepts an Excel file path and a single column index as a parameter. This function sorts the data based on the specified column in descending order using the pandas library and returns a new Excel file with the sorted data.
   - Reason: This revision specifies that the function works with a single column, making it more focused and understandable.

3. Write a Python function named "excel_sort" that takes an input Excel file path and a column index number as parameters. This function sorts the data based on the specified column in descending order using the pandas library and returns the sorted data as an Excel file (xlsl format), utilizing the openpyxl engine for loading.
   - Reason: This revision adds clarity by specifying the use of the "openpyxl" engine for loading Excel files and provides a more detailed explanation of the function's behavior.

4. Create a Python function named 'excel_sort' that accepts an Excel file path and a column index number as arguments. The function should sort the data in descending order based on the specified column using the pandas library. The function should then return the sorted data as an in-memory Excel object. Importantly, the original file should not be modified, and the new file should not be saved to disk.
   - Reason: This is a major rewrite to clearly define the requirements, emphasizing that the function should return sorted data as an in-memory object without saving it to disk, and it should not modify the original file.

5. Define a Python function called `excel_sort` that receives two arguments: an Excel file path and a column index number. This function will utilize the pandas library to sort the data based on the specified column in descending order. The function must return the sorted data as an in-memory Excel object without modifying the original file or saving the new file to disk.
   - Reason: I have revised the prompt several times to better clarify its requirements and improve its readability. The current revision specifies that the function should take an Excel file path and a column index number as arguments, sort the data based on the specified column in descending order using the pandas library, and return the sorted data as an in-memory Excel object without modifying the original file or saving the new file to disk.

6. Write a Python function called `excel_sort` with two parameters: an Excel file path and a column index number. This function will use the pandas library to sort the data based on the specified column in descending order. The function must save to the disk temp file already with the sorted data and return it's path. PS: It should handle columns with mixed data types, handle sorting of strings,int,floats,dates,etc.
   - Reason: This revision clarifies that the function should save the sorted data to a temporary file on disk and return the path to that file. It also specifies that the function should handle columns with mixed data types, such as strings, integers, floats, and dates.
