## compare directories EX-01 versions:

# Original Prompt: Write a python function called "compare_directories" that takes two input directories as parameters, then through a control variable that can be a list, dictionary or tuple, check all files for how many times you found a file with the same name, then for each one that was found 2 times (one in each directory), compare their modification dates. The final result to be displayed should be an 'OK' message if everything passed, otherwise display how many failed in each test and the names of the files that failed and where they failed.
